# MCAerial Mod [1.12.2]

## What is this?
MCAerial mod is a minecraft mod that adds a few planes, helicopters, and land vehicles into the game.

It also serves as the guide to the important concepts in Minecraft and Forge. If you are anything like me, a detailed explanation with a good code example is worth or hours of online googling, and can very quickly explain the key concepts.

You can take a look at my **[MCAerial Mod Documentation](https://apo11o-m.github.io/MCAerial_Documentation/)** that explains the concepts of Minecraft and Forge. I tried to make the code simple and I have also left comments through out the code that explains some of the details that are not covered in the documentation.

## Getting Started
### Documentation
The documentation for this mod can be found in on the [MCAerial Documentation](https://apo11o-m.github.io/MCAerial_Documentation/) page.

### Usage
If you want to play around with this mod in minecraft, here is the download [link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/fvy2urhd7a97f8n/MC_Aerial_Mod_v1.1.jar/file).
1. Make sure you have already installed Minecraft Forge 1.12.2
2. Locate the minecraft application folder.
3. Download the mod and place it in the Mods folder
4. When you launch Minecraft and click the mods button on the menu screen you should now see the mod is installed.

Or if you want to look into the code, you can browse directly in GitHub, or alternatively, download it as a zip and browse it locally.
