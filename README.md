# MCAerial Mod [1.12.2]

## What is this?
MCAerial mod is a minecraft mod that adds a few planes, helicopters, and land vehicles into the game.

It also serves as the guide to the important concepts in Minecraft and Forge. If you are anything like me, a detailed explanation with a good code example is worth or hours of online googling, and can very quickly explain the key concepts.

In the source folder you will find the [documentation](https://github.com/apo11o-M/MCAerial_Mod/tree/readme/src) that explains the concepts of Minecraft and Forge. I tried to make the code simple and I have also left comments through out the code that explains some of the details that are not covered in the documentation.

## Getting Started
### Documentation
The detailed documentation for this mod can be found in the [src folder](https://github.com/apo11o-M/MCAerial_Mod/tree/readme/src)

### Usage
If you just want to play around with this mod, here is the download [link]().
1. Make sure you have already installed Minecraft Forge 1.12.2
2. Locate the minecraft application folder.
    - On windows open Run from the start menu, type %appdata% and click Run.
    - On mac open finder, hold down ALT and click Go then Library in the top menu bar. Open the folder Application Support and look for Minecraft.
